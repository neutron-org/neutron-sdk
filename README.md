This repository contains the source code of Neutron Cosmwasm SDK for interacting with [Neutron blockchain](https://github.com/neutron-org/neutron)

## Overview

### Neutron SDK

The Neutron SDK is contained inside `packages` folder and consists of the following subpackages:

### Example Contracts

We provide sample contracts that either implement or consume these specifications to both provide examples, and provide a basis for code you can extend for more custom contacts, without worrying about reinventing the wheel each time:

| Contract                                         | Reference                                                                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Neutron Interchain Queries Example Contract      | <https://github.com/neutron-org/neutron-sdk/tree/main/contracts/neutron_interchain_queries> | The contract shows how to properly work with [Interchain Queries Module](https://github.com/neutron-org/neutron/tree/master/x/interchainqueries) using [Interchain Queries SDK package](https://github.com/neutron-org/neutron-contracts/tree/main/packages/neutron-sdk/src/interchain_queries) via CosmWasm smart-contract.           |
| Neutron Interchain Transactions Example Contract | <https://github.com/neutron-org/neutron-sdk/tree/main/contracts/neutron_interchain_txs>     | The contract shows how to properly work with [Neutron Interchain Transactions Module](https://github.com/neutron-org/neutron/tree/master/x/interchaintxs) using [Interchain Transactions SDK package](https://github.com/neutron-org/neutron-contracts/tree/main/packages/neutron-sdk/src/interchain_txs) via CosmWasm smart-contract. |
| Neutron IBC Transfer Example Contract            | <https://github.com/neutron-org/neutron-sdk/tree/main/contracts/ibc_transfer>               | The contract shows how to properly work with [Neutron Sudo Package](https://github.com/neutron-org/neutron-contracts/tree/main/packages/neutron_sudo) to handle a callback from IBC transfer.                                                                                                                                          |

## Development

### Environment Setup

- Rust v1.78.0+
- `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target
- Docker

1. Install `rustup` via <https://rustup.rs/>

2. Run the following:

```sh
rustup default stable
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

3. Make sure [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is installed

### Unit Tests

Each contract contains Rust unit tests embedded within the contract source directories. You can run:

```sh
make test
```

### Generating schema

```sh
make schema
```

### Generating proto files

Neutron proto files represented as generated Rust code is a part of the Neutron SDK. In case Neutron
proto files have changed there's a command for Rust generated code rebuild. To rebuild the files,
run the following command:

```sh
make build-proto
```

### Production

For production builds, run the following:

```sh
make build
```

This performs several optimizations which can significantly reduce the final size of the contract binaries, which will be available inside the `artifacts/` directory.
